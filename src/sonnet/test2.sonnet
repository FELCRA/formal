This is a test file

    module test

        f x 0 = 1000
        | x y = 1 + y

        f 10 0 == 1000
        f 100 0 == 1000
        f (f 1 0) 10 == 11

Modules
-------
These are some tests to make sure modules work as advertised

        module fibonacci

            fib 0 = 0 | 1 = 1 | n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

            fib 0 == 0
            fib 1 == 1
            fib 5 == 5

            map f x = f x
           
            map fib 6 == 8
            map fib 7 == 13

These should only be visible externally if we open the module

        open fibonacci
		
        fib 7 == 13
